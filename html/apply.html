				<p class="p">The Yale School of Art is a graduate school that confers Master of Fine Arts Degrees in Graphic Design, Painting/Printmaking, Photography, and Sculpture
				<br>
		    	<br>
				For information on applications to the MFA program, please read the “Graduate Admission” below.

The undergraduate admissions process is handled entirely through Yale College. Please refer all undergraduate admissions questions to the Yale College Undergraduate Admissions Office.</p>

		<section class="sectionnA"><h2 class="animate__animated animate__flash">Graduate Admission</h2>
		  <p class="pA">ADMISSION
Students are admitted to Yale’s MFA for the Fall semester of each year only. Applicants are notified of the admission committee’s decisions on preliminary selections in February, and final decisions in early March. No information about decisions will be given over the phone or advance of the batch written release to all finalists.

To apply for more than one area of concentration, separate applications and supporting documentation must be submitted. The work submitted should be representative of the applicant’s experience in that particular field. Applying to more than one program does not increase an applicant’s chances of selection.

Please note: Yale School of Art does not practice admission deferment; An offer of admission is valid only for enrollment for that year regardless of the in-residence conditions of the Yale campus at that time. Applicants who are offered admission but choose not to enroll are welcome to reapply to the School in a future cycle.

			  The Financial Aid process for the Yale School of Art’s graduate MFA program functions cyclically with each academic year. Students are responsible for submitting different Financial Aid-related information depending on where they are in the Financial Aid process.

		  <p class="pA"> 
			  In the following listings, courses numbered 110 through 499 are studio electives offered to students from Yale College and the graduate and professional schools. Permission of the instructor is required for enrollment in all courses. Graduate students of the School of Art who wish to broaden their experience outside their area of concentration have priority in enrollment.

Courses numbered 500 and above are offered only to graduate students of the School of Art. In exceptional cases qualified Yale College students may enroll in a graduate course, with the permission of both the instructor and the director of undergraduate studies. Please refer to the section on Academic Regulations for further pertinent details. It should be noted that, as a matter of policy, all faculty members teach on both the graduate and undergraduate levels, although the degree and the nature of contact may vary.

Tutorials, which are special courses that cannot be obtained through regular class content, require a proposal written by the student and the faculty member concerned, defining both content and requirements. Proposals must be presented to the Academic Subcommittee for approval.</p>

		  <p class="pA ">
			OFF CAMPUS HOUSING RESOURCES
Yale is home to 6,500 Graduate and Professional School students, many of whom prefer to live off campus. The University offers limited on-campus housing options for graduate and PhD students, so the Yale Housing Office maintains a portal with Off-Campus Listings in which the property owners are verified.
We recommend starting there, or with listings that will be updated on this page from within the School of Art community, or on the closed Facebook Group. As you look for apartments Yale recommends trying to stay within the Yale Shuttle routes to benefit from this service as well as campus safety resources such as the LiveSafe app, but this is of course up to you:<br><br>
